    "\n",
    "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their variants (LSTMs, GRUs) were the go-to architecture for sequential data. But they had **fundamental limitations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Problem | Impact | Example |\n",
    "|---------|--------|---------|\n",
    "| **Sequential Processing** | No parallelization, slow training | Processing a 1000-word document takes 1000 sequential steps |\n",
    "| **Vanishing Gradients** | Can't learn long-range dependencies | Struggles to connect \"The cat\" with \"it\" 50 words later |\n",

    "\n",
    "**Why Transformers Are Revolutionary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Parallel Processing ⚡**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike RNNs that process words one-by-one, Transformers process ALL words simultaneously:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "RNN approach (SLOW ❌):\n",
    "Step 1: Process word 1 → h₁\n",
    "Step 2: Process word 2 → h₂ (waits for h₁)\n",
    "Step 3: Process word 3 → h₃ (waits for h₂)\n",

    "Transformer approach (FAST ✅):\n",
    "Step 1: Process ALL 1000 words in parallel!\n",
    "```\n",

    "**Impact:** Training time reduced from weeks to days or even hours!\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Direct Long-Range Connections 🔗**\n",
    "\n",
    "Every word can directly attend to every other word, regardless of distance:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "🎯 **Causal masking** = Ensures train/test consistency (no cheating!)\n",

    "🎯 **Combined masking** = Both benefits for production language models!\n",
