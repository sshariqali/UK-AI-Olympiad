    "**The Dark Ages Before Transformers (Pre-2017)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before 2017, the AI landscape looked very different. Let's understand the problems that held back progress:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The RNN Era (1990s-2017):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their variants (LSTMs, GRUs) were the go-to architecture for sequential data. But they had **fundamental limitations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Problem | Impact | Example |\n",
    "|---------|--------|---------|\n",
    "| **Sequential Processing** | No parallelization, slow training | Processing a 1000-word document takes 1000 sequential steps |\n",
    "| **Vanishing Gradients** | Can't learn long-range dependencies | Struggles to connect \"The cat\" with \"it\" 50 words later |\n",
    "| **Memory Bottleneck** | Information compressed into fixed-size hidden state | Early context gets \"forgotten\" in long sequences |\n",
    "| **Training Time** | Days or weeks on powerful GPUs | A large model might take 2-3 weeks to train |\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Breakthrough: \"Attention Is All You Need\" (2017)**\n",
    "\n",
    "In June 2017, researchers at Google published a paper with a bold claim: **\"Attention Is All You Need\"**. They introduced the **Transformer architecture**, which threw away recurrence entirely and relied solely on attention mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*BgYbFWLPOwqk7peFHnPpQw.png\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Transformers Are Revolutionary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Parallel Processing ⚡**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike RNNs that process words one-by-one, Transformers process ALL words simultaneously:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "RNN approach (SLOW ❌):\n",
    "Step 1: Process word 1 → h₁\n",
    "Step 2: Process word 2 → h₂ (waits for h₁)\n",
    "Step 3: Process word 3 → h₃ (waits for h₂)\n",
    "...1000 sequential steps...\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformer approach (FAST ✅):\n",
    "Step 1: Process ALL 1000 words in parallel!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact:** Training time reduced from weeks to days or even hours!\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Direct Long-Range Connections 🔗**\n",
    "\n",
    "Every word can directly attend to every other word, regardless of distance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "RNN: Word 1 → Word 50 requires 49 hops (information decays)\n",
    "Transformer: Word 1 → Word 50 is just 1 hop (direct connection!)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact:** Models can finally understand long-range dependencies like humans do!\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Scalability 📈**\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers scale beautifully with more data and compute:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model | Parameters | Training Data | Performance |\n",
    "|-------|-----------|---------------|-------------|\n",
    "| GPT-1 (2018) | 117M | 5GB text | Good |\n",
    "| GPT-2 (2019) | 1.5B | 40GB text | Better |\n",
    "| GPT-3 (2020) | 175B | 570GB text | Amazing |\n",
    "| GPT-4 (2023) | ~1.8T | Unknown | Mind-blowing 🤯 |\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Law:** More parameters + more data = better performance (this didn't work well for RNNs!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Transfer Learning 🎓**\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-train once, fine-tune for many tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Pre-training: Learn language from billions of words\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Fine-tuning: Adapt to specific tasks with small datasets\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Tasks: Translation, summarization, Q&A, code generation, etc.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "**Beyond Text: Transformers Everywhere**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer architecture isn't just for language anymore:\n",
