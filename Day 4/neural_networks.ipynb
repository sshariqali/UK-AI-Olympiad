    "Before we can use the dataset for building our predictive model, it's essential to preprocess the data. This ensures that our model interprets the data correctly and efficiently. Here are the key preprocessing steps we'll undertake:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Converting Categorical Data to Numerical Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset includes categorical data (like `Yes` or `No` responses). Machine learning models, however, work with numerical data. Thus, we will convert these responses into binary numerical values (`1` or `0`):\n",
    "- `Yes` will be converted to `1`.\n",
    "- `No` will be converted to `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Normalizing Feature Values**\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature normalization is crucial in data preprocessing for machine learning models, especially when features vary widely in scale and units.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, in our dataset, the `Previous Scores` typically range from `0` to `100`, representing the scores students obtained in previous tests. In contrast, `Sample Question Papers Practiced` might range typically from `0` to `10`, reflecting how many practice tests a student has completed. If these features are used as-is, the model might inappropriately prioritize `Previous Scores` over `Sample Question Papers Practiced` because of their larger numerical range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization adjusts the scale of features so they contribute equally to model training, enhancing the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose we'll use **Z-score Normalization**, a common normalization method. It transforms each feature to have a mean (average) of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This standardization process involves the following formula for each feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ X_{\\text{norm}} = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $ X $ is the original value of a feature.\n",
    "- $ \\mu $ is the mean of the feature.\n",
    "- $ \\sigma $ is the standard deviation of the feature.\n",
    "- $ X_{\\text{norm}} $ is the normalized value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method ensures that features with larger scales do not dominate those with smaller scales, leading to a more balanced and fair input to the model.\n"
