    "Welcome to one of the most famous machine learning competitions on Kaggle! The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered \"unsinkable\" RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren't enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step guide to build your solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: Import Libraries**\n",
    "Import the necessary libraries: `torch`, `torch.nn`, `torch.optim`, `Dataset`, `DataLoader`, `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 2: Load and Explore Data**\n",
    "- Load `train.csv` and `test.csv` using pandas\n",
    "- Explore the data using `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 3: Data Preprocessing**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **most important step** for tabular data! Unlike images, you need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.1. Handle Missing Values**\n",
    "- Check for missing values using `.isnull().sum()`\n",
    "- Fill missing `Age` with median\n",
    "- Fill missing `Embarked` with mode (most common value)\n",
    "- Fill missing `Fare` with median\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.2. Convert Categorical Variables to Numbers**\n",
    "- Convert `Sex` to binary (male=0, female=1) using `.map()`\n",
    "- Convert `Embarked` to numbers (S=0, C=1, Q=2)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.3. Feature Selection**\n",
    "- Select useful features (remove irrelevant ones like Name, Ticket, Cabin)\n",
    "- Suggested features: `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Fare`, `Embarked`\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.4. Feature Scaling (Normalization)**\n",
    "- Normalize features to range [0, 1] using `MinMaxScaler` from sklearn\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 4: Create Custom Dataset**\n",
    "- Create a `TitanicDataset` class that inherits from `Dataset`\n",
    "- Implement `__init__`, `__len__`, and `__getitem__` methods\n",
    "- Convert features and labels to PyTorch tensors\n",
    "- Create a `DataLoader` with appropriate batch size\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 5: Define Neural Network Architecture**\n",
    "- Create a `TitanicNet` class that inherits from `nn.Module`\n",
    "- Add hidden layers with ReLU activation\n",
    "- **Important:** Output layer should have only **1 neuron** for binary classification!\n",
    "- No activation on output layer (loss function handles it)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 6: Define Loss Function and Optimizer**\n",
    "- Use `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()` for binary classification (includes sigmoid)\n",
    "- Use `optim.Adam` optimizer with learning rate ~0.001\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 7: Training Loop**\n",
    "- Loop through epochs\n",
    "- For each batch: forward pass → compute loss → backward pass → optimizer step\n",
    "- Apply sigmoid and threshold (0.5) to get predictions\n",
    "- Track and print loss and accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 8: Make Predictions on Test Set**\n",
    "- **Important:** Apply the SAME preprocessing to test data as training data\n",
    "- Use the SAME scaler (`.transform()`, not `.fit_transform()`)\n",
    "- Convert to tensor and run through model in eval mode\n",
    "- Apply sigmoid and threshold to get final predictions (0 or 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 9: Create Submission File**\n",
    "- Create a DataFrame with `PassengerId` and `Survived` columns\n",
    "- Save to CSV using `.to_csv('titanic_submission.csv', index=False)`\n",
    "\n",

    "### **Important Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Apply the SAME preprocessing to test data as training data**\n",

    "⚠️ **Ensure test features are in the SAME order as training features**\n",
